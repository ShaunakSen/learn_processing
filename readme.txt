Basics of Drawing

rect(x, y, width, height)

Color: background(), stroke() and fill()

r==g==b => greyscale
255, 255, 255 => white : all colors at their brightest produce white
absence of colors is black
fill(150) => fill(150, 150, 150)

background(), stroke() and fill() can take rgba values too

The function setup() occurs only once but draw() happens in a loop
